forge e-mails!

A little background information:
Back before the days of popular email websites such as Hotmail, Yahoo, and G-mail that gives users a GUI, 
there was a system called SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) that was the primary way to send messages.


We use python in orderr to send a mail from ANY mail address via Telnet, connecting with an SMTP server who don't requires
autentication.
